Methods of String and array
String Methods:
1)splice(startposition, endPosition)

to split the string from particular index to endPosition both these indiices are excluded from resulting string. If end position is not provided then entire string from startposition is spliced out.

2)substring()

similar to splice but cannot accept negative values i.e slicing string in reverse order from last index to first.

3)substr(startposition,lengthofsubstring)

similar to substring() method but instead of endPosition we pass lengthofsubstring as second argument so only that many characters are spliced out.

4)replace(old,new)
replaces the existing characters from a string to new characters
By default replaces only first occurance
is case sensitive

5)trim()
removes white spaces from string from end and beginning.

array methods:
splice(position,no. of elements to be removed,new elements)
In arrays spice is used to add new elements to array.

sort()
works fine for string to sort in ascending order

reverse()
to reverse or sort in descending order.
