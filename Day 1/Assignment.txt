Q1) Explore and explain various methods in console function
Ans: console is an object that provides access to the browser's debugging console.
Following are some methods of console object along with their usage:

1) console.log()
simply logs whatever passed to the method.
ex: if we have a string var name ="First thing";
then, console.log(name);
would simply print "First thing" in browser console.

2) console.warn()
dispalys the message/string passed as a warning on browser console.
ex:console.warn("this is a warning");

3)console.error()
displays the message as error.
ex: console.log("Alert!");

4)console.clear()
clears the browser console like a clean slate.

5)console.table()
outputs the data in form of a table

6)console.time() & console.timeEnd()
console.time() Starts a timer with a name specified as an input parameter whereas  console.timeEnd() can be considered as end point to stop the timer.
ex: console.time("TimerHere")
    var a=9;
    var b=8;
    var c= a+b;
    console.timeEnd("TimerHere");
    the above console method will out take taken by JS Engine to evaluate 3 lines b/w time & timeEnd methods.


 Q 2) write difference b/w var, let and const 
var is used to declare a variable of global scope if that variable is assigned some other value later in the code then the variable will be updated with latest change.
ex: 
var name="sanjay";
name="jay";
console.log(name);

output: jay

let is used more as a modern way of declaring variable.
i.e to declare varables of same name containing diffenent values for global and local scope.
ex:
var name="sanjay";
{
    let name = "sanjana";
    console.log("the value of name in local scope:",name)
}
console.log("the global value of name  ",name);

output:the value of name in local scope: sanjana
     the global value of name   sanjay

const is used to declare constants i.e once declared their value cannot be changed throughout the program.
However we have to be careful of a few thongs while declaring constants. 
They must be declared with initialization,
const array can be changed but cannot be declared with new values.
ex:
const person;
person="Ajay";
console.log(person);

output: Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration

const newPerson= "Ajay"
newPerson ="vijay"
console.log(newPerson);

output:Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

const names=["amar","akbar"];
names.push("anthony");
console.log(names);

output:Â ["amar", "akbar", "anthony"]

Q3) write brief intro of datatypes;
Ans Information can only be stored in form of data. To store data we need variable,depending upon the kind of data/information we want to store,we can choose most suitable data type for the variable.

following are different types of datatypes in javascript:
string:
To store data in string format. can be used to store data like name,place etc;
ex: var name="Mane"

Number:
To store numerical data , can be float/decimal value as well.
ex; var percentage= 59.92;

Boolean:
To store data in form of boolean value i.e true/false. Mostly used for storing response,state etc.
var isMale= true;

Array:
To store data in a continuous block of data we can use array.
ex: var days = ["Mon","Tues","Wed"]

Object:
To store the common properties of a class.
ex : var student={
    name:"Shabana";
    roll no:24;
    subject:"IT";
}
